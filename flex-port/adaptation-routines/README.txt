This folder contains the routines from the Flex Adaptation guide as copied
in April 2018 to text from the PDFS of 6809 FLEXâ„¢ Adaptation Guide 1980

These are all called i.e. org/AppF.NEWDISK.org.txt

The perl script ../scripts/TXT2ASM.pl converts the scripts to .org.asm files sorting out
formatting and spaces

I've then edited the results into the folder fix - these should all be good to go except for 
lines ^;...; in AppG code which need copying in from elsewhere.
